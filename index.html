                        Becoming India’s no. 1 fashion destination is not an easy feat. Sincere efforts, digital
                        enhancements and a team of dedicated personnel with an equally loyal customer base have made
                        Myntra
                        the online platform that it is today. The original B2B venture for personalized gifts was
                        conceived
                        in 2007 but transitioned into a full-fledged ecommerce giant within a span of just a few years.
                        By
                        2012, Myntra had introduced 350 Indian and international brands to its platform, and this has
                        only
                        grown in number each passing year. Today Myntra sits on top of the online fashion game with an

                        Another reason why Myntra is the best of all online stores is the complete convenience that it
                        offers. You can view your favourite brands with price options for different products in one
                        place. A
                        user-friendly interface will guide you through your selection process. Comprehensive size
                        charts,
                        product information and high-resolution images help you make the best buying decisions. You also
                        have the freedom to choose your payment options, be it card or cash-on-delivery. The 14-day
                        returns
                        policy gives you more power as a buyer. Additionally, the try-and-buy option for select products
                        takes customer-friendliness to the next level.
